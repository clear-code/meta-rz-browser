# Overview

This layer provides browser integration for Renesas RZ/G platforms.

It extends the vendor BSP with packages, configuration, and workarounds
required to build and run a modern web browser environment. The current
implementation is based on Chromium, but the layer is intended to provide
general browser integration rather than being Chromium-specific.

The layer includes:

* Browser package groups for RZ/G platforms
* Browser runtime packages and configuration
* Browser-specific BSP workarounds when required
* Hardware-assisted video decoding support using the Chromium V4L2 video
  decoder and the v4l-gst bridge

Currently, hardware-assisted video decoding supports H.264 and H.265 through
GStreamer-based vendor decoders.

# Building

Assuming the Renesas BSP has already been set up, clone the required layers.

The Chromium recipe depends on external layers such as `meta-clang` and
`meta-lts-mixins`. Since Chromium is sensitive to layer revisions, we recommend
using the tested revision combination below.

## Supported layer combination

```console
$ (git clone https://github.com/kraj/meta-clang.git && \
   cd meta-clang && \
   git checkout eea5ec23155cfd47781599fdc9a92c21e4caffc8)
$ (git clone https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-lts-mixins && \
   cd meta-lts-mixins && \
   git checkout a8046d5ec53b1856169ac795aa87cb0d5db84c04)
$ git clone --branch rzg-scarthgap/chromium132-20260508 --single-branch \
  https://github.com/clear-code/meta-browser.git
$ git clone \
  https://github.com/clear-code/meta-rz-browser.git
```

Then initialize the build environment:
```console
$ source poky/oe-init-build-env
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-clang
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-lts-mixins
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-browser/meta-chromium
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-rz-browser
```

Build the image:
```console
$ MACHINE=<your-machine> bitbake core-image-weston
```

The layer automatically extends the vendor BSP through dynamic layers when the
corresponding RZ/G layers are present.

## Additional build configuration

### `use-v4l2-overlay`

To additionally enable the experimental V4L2 no-scale hardware overlay path,
add the following to your `conf/local.conf`:

```conf
PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-chromium-ozone-wayland = " use-v4l2-overlay"
```

The `use-v4l2-overlay` option is intended for RZ/G Wayland/Weston systems where
decoded NV12 dmabufs can be promoted to a KMS plane without scaling or cropping.
It is kept separate from `use-v4l2` because it can affect composition behavior,
such as drawing video above overlapping HTML controls. Enabling
`use-v4l2-overlay` also enables `use-v4l2`.

If Chromium is built with `use-v4l2` but without `use-v4l2-overlay`, the overlay
path is disabled by default. You can enable it for an individual launch without
editing the Chromium wrapper by adding the following runtime option:

```console
$ chromium --enable-v4l2-no-scale-overlay
```

The same scaling, cropping, and composition limitations apply when enabling
the overlay path at runtime.

### Disabling Chromium managed policy

By default, this layer installs a Chromium managed policy file that suppresses
startup dialogs commonly undesirable in embedded environments, including the
command-line flag security warning shown when the `--no-sandbox` is used and the
browser sign-in prompt.

To restore the default Chromium behavior, add the following to your
`conf/local.conf`:

```conf
RDEPENDS:packagegroup-rz-browser:remove = "chromiumpolicy"
```

# Running

Build and boot the generated image as usual.

Chromium can be started normally, for example:

```console
$ chromium
```

Hardware-assisted video decoding is enabled automatically when the required
multimedia components are available.

If you want to launch Chromium as the root user (e.g. via serial console), you
need the `--no-sandbox` option:

```console
# chromium --no-sandbox
```
